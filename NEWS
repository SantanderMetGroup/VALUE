# VALUE changelog

Package VALUE is the continuation of the former package [R.VALUE](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/R_VALUE). See the full history in <https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/R_VALUE/releases>

## v2.0.0 (10 May 2019)
 * `loadValueStations` has been deprecated, and will be eventually removed in future package versions. The user is now referred to `loadStationData` from package `loadeR`
 * New functions `show.indices` and `show.measures`, providing a list of available indices/measures 
 * New atomic functions for validation:
   * `valueIndex1D`, for index calculation
   * `valueMeasure1D`, for measure calculation 
 * New internal example datasets: `tmin.det` 

## v2.1.0 (12 Jul 2019)
 * Add new measure: ROC Skill Score
 * Other minor documentation updates

## v2.1.1 (13 Jul 2019)
 * Added PRUDENCE region metadata to VALUE-ECA-86 dataset

## v2.2.0 (06 Dic 2019)
 * New `measure.rocss` function for ROC skill score calculation of probabilistic predictions
 * New `measure.ks.pval` returning (corrected) p-values for the ks score. Package checks yield a warning due to the internal call to `stats:::C_pSmirnov2x`, not part of the API. 
 * Introduce dates argument in measure.ks for compatibility with `climate4R.VALUE::valueMeasure` calls
 * Other minor changes and documentation updates
